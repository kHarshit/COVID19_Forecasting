# COVID-19 Analysis and Forecasting

## Problem Description

COVID-19 spreads faster than any other disease and has an exponential growth rate around the
world. Scientists aimed to flatten this curve, for which they need records and data about the
impact and spread of COVID-19 in future cases for all the countries in the world. For this, we can
perform predictions and Time Series Forecasting to analyze and take preventive measures to
reduce the growth rate of COVID-19.

The goal of this project is to

1. Analyze the growth of COVID-19 cases.
2. Train machine learning algorithms that can forecast the future trend and predict the number of cases based on previous data.

* Input: Previous data of COVID-19 cases.
* Output: Future prediction of cases and comparison of various algorithms.

### Dataset
The Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset will be used. It consists of time-based, region-wise data of COVID cases – confirmed, death, recovered.
